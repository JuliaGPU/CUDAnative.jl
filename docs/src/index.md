# CUDAnative.jl

Welcome to the API reference documentation of CUDAnative.jl. This documentation is a work in
progress. For general usage instructions of CUDAnative.jl and the rest of the Julia CUDA
toolchain, please refer to the [CUDA.jl documentation](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/).

This API reference is split into two parts: Functionality you can use on the host CPU, e.g.
to compile code or otherwise work with the CUDA toolkit, and functionality that you use
on-device in GPU kernels.
